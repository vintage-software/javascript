### Components

Angular 1.5 introduced the component model from Angular2 to help a migration path to ng2. This also simplifies reusable components and eliminates the need for directives. If you project can support 1.5 please default to using Components over Directives. See [Todd Motto Angular 1.5 compoents](http://toddmotto.com/exploring-the-angular-1-5-component-method/).
